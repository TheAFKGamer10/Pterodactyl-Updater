# Pterodactyl-Updater
This script will update your [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io) instance and also copy any files you have changed and install then.

## Use the script 
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheAFKGamer10/Pterodactyl-Updater/WinTest/updatedev.sh)
```

## What does it do?
This script will ask you how you would like to update your panel. 
You can choose to update just the panel, or to install files that you have changed. The first time you choose to `Update with changed files` it will create a directory called `Changedfiles` and inside that folder another directory called `pterodactyl`. This is where you will put your changed files. The script will then copy those files and install them.
